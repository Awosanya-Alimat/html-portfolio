<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Awosanya Alimat Oluwasholape, but you can call me Haleemah. I’m 20 years old. I'm from lagos state.
   I'm an Aerospace Engineering student at Lagos State University, currently in my 200 level.
   I’m on a journey to become the best version of myself—academically, spiritually, and creatively.</p>

<p>Alongside studying Aerospace Engineering, I’m also a tech enthusiast learning full-stack web development.
   I believe in growth through consistency, and that’s why I’m building my personal brand “Ms.Haleemah” on YouTube, 
   LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter. Through these platforms, I’ll document my journey—not just in academics
    and tech, but in everything that makes me who I am. From entrepreneurship to video editing, baking, sports, public speaking,
     and the little moments in between, I’ll share it all. It’s more than just content; it’s my story in motion—raw, real, and evolving</p>

<p>My goal is to keep learning, growing, and becoming the best version of myself—while helping others do the same. I’ve also recently started my journey in public speaking, where I hope to inspire and encourage others through my voice and story.
This is just the beginning, and I’d love for you to grow with me.</p>
